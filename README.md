# Sinatra Project
## IMnotDB
IMnotDB is a movie review app that lets you search for a movie and enter your review. See what other users are saying about the movies in their list.   

IMnotDB was created for the Flatiron School's Online Web Development Program using Sinatra. The formatting of the app was created using Bootstrap.

For more information on how to use the app, see my [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA8Cd4-XNbw&t=1s)!
